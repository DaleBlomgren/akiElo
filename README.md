# akiElo

This is a website that connects to a database that holds player data.  This then displays a players relative skill!  This was built with Node and a mongodb as my main database.

## Dependencies
Most should be included in the git project, but you will need to run a mongo database somewhere to hold your data.  

Load the code up with
'''
node akiElo.js
